<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Liri is a bot that I created as a tool for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interfacing. Liri processes commands and returns requested data to the user.

The user may use one of four commands:

1. concert-this
2. spotify-this-song
3. movie-this
4. do-what-it-says </p>

<h1> How to Use: </h1>
<p>
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to the file liri.js
3. Try running one of the four commands
    a. concert-this
    b. spotify-this-song
    c. movie-this
    d. do-what-it-says
        ex. "node liri.js concert-this <name of artist or band>
Expected Output: The terminal will display a list of all events and locations where the artist/band may be performing. The results will simultaneously be logged to the the log.txt file.
